This is a short, observational documentary shot for a year 11 session 2 documentary project. My original idea was to shoot a documentary about busking, however on the day we shot (17/07/21), it was rainy, and so we had to come up with something else quick. This is the result. Edited in four hours from 12:21am-4:33am (20/08/21), fueled by an odd mix of Mango Loco and sleep deprivation.
