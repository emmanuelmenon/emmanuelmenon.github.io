This year, I enrolled in a program called Science Mentors ACT. The aim of this program is to help students from year 9-12 in the ACT get better at science by pairing them up with a mentor who is proficient in the student's chosen field of study. The student will then write a scientific paper in collaboration with their mentor.

Once accepted into the program, Mr. O'Donohue and I looked at a bunch of different ideas for projects. Some examples include:
- Comparing the efficiency of different sorting algorithms
- Testing the effects of repeated training on a machine learning model based on the MNIST dataset
- Increase employee productivity by training a machine learning model to recognize the efficiencies of different employees after working for varied periods of time. This would then be used to recognize individual employee “burnout times”

While all these ideas were interesting (I might use some of these next year, if I decide to do it again), we finally settled on making and RPS bot. Although the idea did seem quite simple at first glance, it had the ability to scale its difficulty based on how deep I want to get into this project.

This "Programming an RPS Bot" series of posts will explain (or aim to) some of the code and theory surrounding each of the bots I develop and will end with me posting my final report.
