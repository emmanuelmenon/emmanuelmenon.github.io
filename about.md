Hey there! Welcome to my blog! I'm Emmanuel Menon, a world-renowned recluse who enjoys watching films and learning new things, things that I will probably never use in day to day life. Pictured to the right is me, emerging from my cave after watching all 10 episodes of the Dekalog.

If you are interested, check out my film reviews on [LetterBoxd](https://letterboxd.com/emmanuelmenon). My GitHub is also avalable [here](https://github.com/emmanuelmenon/). I've kept a log of all the films I've watched since October 14th 2018, which you can check out [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17L6FQYznF9GzyKYIwTJBpKd8MP8I-PCeQ8B3RXGwzcY/edit#gid=2079998586/). I've also done some basic number *crunch* ing on said spreadsheet to *squeeze* some relatively interesting [statistics]((https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17L6FQYznF9GzyKYIwTJBpKd8MP8I-PCeQ8B3RXGwzcY/edit#gid=532583700/)) out of it.
