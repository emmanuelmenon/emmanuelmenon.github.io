<p class="nomargin">Welcome to my website! I am desperate for human interaction, so please, feel free to comment! However, when you comment, make sure that your comment abides by these guidelines:</p>
- Be NICE – if you are nice to people, they will almost certainly be nice to you
- RESPECT people even if you don't agree with their opinions – who knows, your calm demeanor may convince them that your opinion is right
- Don't SPAM – please
- No NSFW content – ever

Help me out! If you see someone not abiding by these guidelines, report and flag them.

__TLDR – Be excellent to each other and party on dudes!__
